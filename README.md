# Flights-Scheduling-Management
This project provides most of the functionalities for scheduling of flights and management. This project uses C++ and Object Oriented Programming System (OOPS).

# Overview of the problem statement:
An airport has so many numbers of flights per day. The flight information is fetched from the airport system database for that particular airport, regarding the departure and arrival location of the flight, flight and maintenance number and its pre decided time of departure and arrival. Then there is a passenger check in the airplane and the flight is ready to take off. Once the flight takes off the scheduling crew timestamps the departure time and when the flight lands in the next airport the crew timestamps its arrival
time to the flightâ€™s record. Once a flight is landed it has to wait for a turnaround time until its next take off. In case of maintenance crew detects a problem while taking off of a flight, they can raise a scheduled maintenance test or an unscheduled maintenance test on it if the problem is critical. The scheduling crew can eithe delay a flight, cancel a flight or raise an emergency flag to tell the whole unit to work on a particular airplane. The flights are divided in two groups, domestic and international. Each of them has cargo loaded and passengers to carry and help them to reach to their destination safely.
